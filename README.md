# Module 1: Image Captioning with Generative AI
In this module, I learned the fundamentals of generative AI and foundation models, exploring their architecture and real-world use cases. I gained hands-on experience building an image captioning app using the BLIP model, Gradio for UI, and Hugging Face for accessing pretrained models.
I also learned how to deploy AI apps using IBM Code Engine for scalable and accessible solutions.

Real-World Application
I’ll apply these skills to:
Build generative AI apps with pretrained models
Create interactive UIs using Gradio
Use Hugging Face for model access
Deploy scalable AI solutions with IBM Code Engine

# Module 2: Create Your Own ChatGpt-Like Website
In this module, I learned how to build a ChatGPT-like chatbot using generative AI tools. I worked with BlenderBot via Hugging Face Transformers, explored LLMs, prompt engineering, and designed user interfaces with Flask and Gradio.I also practiced integrating models via APIs and deploying a working conversational AI web app.

Real-World Application
I can now:
Build chatbots with open-source LLMs
Create web-based AI apps using Flask and Gradio
Use Hugging Face to integrate and deploy models
Design functional, browser-accessible conversational AI tools
This module gave me practical skills to create and deploy AI chat applications.

# Module 3: Creating Voice Assistance
I learned to build a generative AI-powered voice assistant by combining OpenAI’s GPT-3 with IBM Watson’s speech-to-text and text-to-speech services. I explored app structure, used Docker for consistent deployment, and developed a prototype that understands spoken input and replies with natural speech.

Real-World Application
Integrate GPT-3 with speech recognition and synthesis APIs
Use Docker for reliable app packaging and deployment
Build voice assistants that interact naturally via audio
Deploy AI-powered voice applications to public servers
This module equipped me to create scalable, voice-enabled AI solutions.

# Module 4: Create APP
I learned to build a generative AI-powered meeting assistant that transcribes, summarizes, and answers questions from meeting content. I explored technologies like IBM watsonx.ai, Meta Llama 2, and OpenAI Whisper to create enterprise-ready AI solutions.

Real-World Application
Develop AI assistants that process and analyze meeting audio
Use IBM watsonx.ai for model training, tuning, and deployment
Choose Meta Llama 2 models based on enterprise needs
Apply OpenAI Whisper for accurate transcription and translation
Build practical AI tools for enhancing business meetings
This module prepared me to implement advanced AI assistants for real-world business use.

# Module 5
I learned how generative AI models like Llama 2 and frameworks like LangChain help efficiently parse, summarize, and understand large amounts of data. I explored how LangChain supports content summarization, data extraction, and question-answering by simplifying the use of advanced NLP techniques like RAG.

Real-World Application
I can now create intelligent chatbots that understand complex documents and provide accurate, context-rich responses—useful for automating data extraction and summarization tasks in various industries.

# Module 6: Create a Translation Assistant
 I learned how to build a real-time voice translator assistant by integrating speech-to-text (STT), large language models like Flan-UL2, and text-to-speech (TTS) using IBM Watson® Speech Libraries. The application converts spoken input into translated speech output, enabling seamless multilingual communication.
 
 # Module 7
I learned how to build a personalized AI-powered career coach using large language models (LLMs). The AI assists job seekers by offering resume feedback, job matching insights, and interview preparation guidance through prompt engineering and user input.

Real-World Application
I will create AI tools that provide tailored career advice, helping users improve their resumes, find suitable jobs, and prepare for interviews—supporting professional growth and job search success.
